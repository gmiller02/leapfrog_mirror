leapfrog README

Hand-in: final hand in

Overview: My leapfrog has four classes: App, Game, Hider, and Seeker.
App contains an instance of Game.
Game's constructor contains an instance of both Hider and Seeker.
I set up an association between Hider and Seeker so that Seeker knows about an instance of Hider.

Design choices: I used containment to instantiate Game in App, and instantiated Hider and Seeker in Game.
Containment allows the outer classes to access other classes as components of itself; so by putting Hider and Seeker
in Game I was able to make them components of the same Game.
I used association by creating an instance of Hider which Seeker knew about. This was necessary because Seeker needed
to know about the previous location of Hider in order to move to that location.

Known bugs: none

Hours: I spent 4 1/2 hours on this project.
